# Anomaly-Detection-in-Energy-Manufacturing
Data is captured from various sensors from a energy manufacturing plant on specific time intervals. The problem is to predict anomaly based on the readings captured by sensors. Columns : {'Date': datetime64[ns], 'X1' : sensor one, 'X2' : sensor two, 'X3' : sensor three, 'X4' : sensor four, 'X5' : sensor five, 'target' : Anomaly(0 or 1) }
